Data Breach Logistic Regression Lab

This repo contains my completed homework for the logistic regression lab using real-world data breach info. The goal was to build a model that predicts whether a breach would be considered large based on things like breach type and organization type.

Whatâ€™s Inside:
Data_Breach_Logistic_Regression.ipynb: The full Jupyter notebook with all code, visualizations, and answers

Data_Breach_Logistic_Regression_Report.pdf: PDF version with all cells run and outputs included

Summary:
The model uses logistic regression to predict large breaches. I explored the data, cleaned it, trained the model, evaluated performance, and reflected on the results. Key takeaways are included at the end of the notebook.
